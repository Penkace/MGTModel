# vc_dynamic
1. main_embedding_training.py : File for generating node representations in VC networks by node classification and link prediction tasks<\br>
2. main.py : Code that dynamically updates newly added nodes and predicts the success of startups
3. You need to run the main_node_traininig.py file to generate a representation of the nodes and then run the main.py file to make predictions about the success of the startups.
4. Model/Convs.py contains **MGTConvs**, which is the layer to dynamically update the nodes. Model/Model.py contains **Predict_model**.
